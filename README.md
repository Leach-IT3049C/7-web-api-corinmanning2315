## Use Cases (How to test)

* Which Web API did you use, and where is it being used in the application?
    I used the Battery API. It checks your battery percentage and displays the percentage.
* What are application use cases?
    Since it is an event listener, the percentage changes automatically without refreshing the page.

## Technical Write-up of selection of Web API selected:

    The Battery API can tell you your devices battery status. You can be notified when the battery level changes, if the device is charging, how long it needs to charge, etc.

## Self Reflection(s):

    This was interesting to learn. I also researched other APIs in the process. There were a few other things I'd like to implement, but I just didn't get around to. Such as identifying when the device is charging. That would have been cool if I could have pulled it off.

## How long it took me/us to finish this:

    A couple hours
